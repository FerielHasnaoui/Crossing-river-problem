# Crossing-river-problem 

Two types of characters (processes), Hackers and Windows developers, try to cross a river with a boat that can hold only 4 passengers. The following patterns must be avoided to guarantee a trip in the right conditions: 1 hacker and 3 Windows, 1 Windows and 3 hackers. Any other schema is "safe" for example 4 W or 4 H or 2/2. The boat will only start once all 4 seats are occupied.
